1. Pick a File DeploymentsPage.vue
2. Find all the dispatches in there that fetch data.
  - getEnvironmentDetail (already fixed)
  
  - dispatchEnvironmentServices(this.$store, Number(this.environmentId)) line 361
    - calls the action dispatchEnvironmentServices in services.ts 
      - actions.fetchEnvironmentServices
      - GET /api/cicada/environments/${environmentId}/serviceSummaries
     - Operation ID: getServiceSummaries
     - Associated mutations, state, and getters:
      - mutations: commitEnvironmentServices wrapper for SET_SELECTED_ENVIRONMENT_SERVICES
       - commitEnvironmentServices used in 
        - partialRehydrationOnRefresh.ts
        - and fetchEnvironmentServices of course
       - SET_SELECTED_ENVIRONMENT_SERVICES wrapper is
        - commitEnvironmentServices of course
        - commitDeleteService which seems to never be used
      - state referenced by mutation is state.selectedEnvironment.services
          - type: IServiceState
            - ISelectedEnvironment
              - services: ISelectedService[]
      - getters that touch state.selectedEnvironment.services
        - getters.services - getter wrapper is getEnvironmentServices
  
  - fetchSelectedServiceFeatures(this.$store, {serviceId: this.serviceId,})
    - calls the action: fetchSelectedServiceFeatures in deployments.ts
      - moduleActions.fetchSelectedServiceFeatures
      - GET /api/cicada/services/${serviceId}/features
      - Operation ID: getServiceFeatures
       - Associated mutations, state and getters:
        - mutations: commitSetSelectedServiceFeatures wrapper for moduleMutations.SET_SELECTED_SERVICE_FEATURES
          - commitSetSelectedServiceFeatures only used twice here in same action (fetchSelectedServiceFeatures)
          - SET_SELECTED_SERVICE_FEATURES only used here
        - state referenced by mutation is state.selectedServiceFeatures
          - type for state: IDeploymentsState
          - but selectedServiceFeatures is type IDeploymentsState.selectedServiceFeatures: AsyncData<ServiceFeature[], AxiosError>
        - getters that touch state.selectedServiceFeatures
          - getters.selectedServiceFeatures
        
      
  - fetchDeploymentsVersions(this.$store, this.environmentId) 
    - calls the action fetchDeploymentVersions in deployments.ts
      moduleActions.fetchDeploymentsVersions
      - GET /api/cicada/environments/${environmentId}/versions
     - Operation ID: getVersions
     - Associate mutations, state and getters:
      - mutations: commitDeploymentsVersions wrapper for moduleMutations.SET_VERSIONS_TAB_VERSIONS
        - commitDeploymentVersions only used here
        - SET_VERSIONS_TAB_VERSIONS only used here
      - state referenced by mutation is state.deploymentsPage.versions
        - type for state: IDeploymentsState in deployments.interface.ts
        - but versions is type IDeploymentPage.versions: object[]
      - getters that touch state.deploymentsPage.versions:
        - getters.versionsTabVersions - getterwrapper is getDeploymentsVersions
   
   3. Replace each dispatch and associated data mutations and getters:
    - Dispatches:
      - dispatchEnvironmentServices(this.$store, Number(this.environmentId))
        - which hits GET /api/cicada/environments/${environmentId}/serviceSummaries
          - Define a new Request Creator in the appropriate requests file in /util/requests/cicada/environmentsRequests
            - name: getServiceSummaries
            - parameters: environmentId!: number, expandAll?: boolean, navigate?:string, serviceId?: number
            - response body: 
              - interface: IGetServiceSummariesResponse in /interfaces/requests/IGetServiceSummariesResponse.interface.ts
            - comment out:
              - old interfaces: revisit, not sure about commenting these out yet
              
          

      - fetchSelectedServiceFeatures(this.$store, {serviceId: this.serviceId,})
        - which hits GET /api/cicada/services/${serviceId}/features
          - Define a new Request Creator in the appropriate requests file in /util/requests/cicada/servicesRequests
            name: getServiceFeatures
            parameter: serviceId
            response body: 
              -interface: IGetServiceFeaturesResponse in /interfaces/requests/IGetServiceFeaturesResponse.interface.ts
        - comment out: 
          - IDeploymentState.selectedServiceFeatures: AsyncData<ServiceFeature[], AxiosError>;
          - initial state at: state.selectedServiceFeatures
          - action fetchSelectedServiceFeatures and wrapper fetchSelectedServiceFeatures
          - mutation moduleMutations.SET_SELECTED_SERVICE_FEATURES and wrapper commitSetSelectedServiceFeatures
          - getters: getters.selectedServiceFeatures and wrapper getSelectedServiceFeatures
        - update code: DeploymentsMenu also uses
        
      - fetchDeploymentsVersions(this.$store, this.environmentId)
        - which hits GET /api/cicada/environments/${environmentId}/versions
           - Define a new Request Creator in the appropriate requests file in /util/requests/cicada/environmentsRequests
            - name: getVersions
            - parameter: environmentId: number
            - response body: 
              - interface = IGetVersionsResponse in /interfaces/requests/IGetEnvironmentDetailResponse.interface.ts
       - comment out: 
        - IDeploymentsPage.versions: object[];
        - state.deploymentsPage.versions
        - action fetchDeploymentVersions and wrapper fetchDeploymentVersions
        - mutation moduleMutations.SET_VERSIONS_TAB_VERSIONS and wrapper commitDeploymentsVersions
        - getters getters.versionsTabVersions and wrapper getDeploymentsVersions
       - update code: VersionsTab.vue also uses
       - dont forget change isBoolean
       - dont forget delete old comments
       - dont forget refreshable check at the end
      
      
     going to need to do fetchSelectedEnvironmentServicesStatuses as well
