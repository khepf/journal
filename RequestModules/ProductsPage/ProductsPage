1. Pick a File ProductsPage.vue
2. Find all the dispatches in there that fetch data.
  - fetchProducts(this.$store) line 93
    - this is a dispatch wrapper that calls the action 
      - export const fetchProducts = dispatch(storeOptions.actions.fetchProducts); in store.ts
      - this goes to /api/cicada/products/summaries
      - Operation ID: getProductSummaries
  - associated getters and mutations:
    - mutations: commitFetchedProducts a wrapper around mutations.SET_PRODUCTS
    - state: state.products
      - type: IRootState and within, products has the type IProduct[] in state.interface.ts
    - getters: getters.products wrapper getter: export const getProducts = read(storeOptions.getters.products);
3. Replace each dispatch and associated data mutations and getters:
  fetchProducts which goes to /api/cicada/products/summaries
  3.1. Define a new Request Creator in the appropriate requests file in /src/util/requests/cicada/productsRequests.
    - name: method: GET Operation ID: getProductSummaries so name will be getProductSummaries
    - parameters: none
    - Response Body: GetProductSummariesResponse
      - interface will be called IGetProductSummariesResponse inside the file
        - /src/interfaces/requests/IGetProductSummariesResponse.interface.ts
  3.2. Comment Out Or Delete The Old Stuff
    - fetchPoducts action and wrapper
    - SET_PRODUCTS mutation and wrapper commitFetchedProducts
    - getters.products and wrapper getProducts
  3.3. Update Code
  3.4. Clean Up
