# A summary of systematically approaching a development task

-Initial outline of operation
- What is the task that needs to be accomplished?
- Determine what I need for each part
- Do I have all the things I need?
- Revised, more detailed outline of operation, after taking into account the above discovery notes

So.... my process should be
1. Identify the problem to be solved
2. Map out the story in Rally BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE, task by task
3. Find out what I need
4. Find out what I already have available
5. Find out where to get what I don't have available
6. Revise Task List in Rally based on changes above
7. Code it out
