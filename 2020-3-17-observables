## What is an Observable? RxJS
- An observable is a data source (user input, events, http requests, triggered in code, etc)
- Observables are constructs to which you subscribe to be informed about changes in data

- An Observer is your code (subscribe, etc)

#### Three ways to handle data packages
1. Handle Data
2. Handle Error
3. Handle Completion of the observable

```
this.route.params.subscribe( next: (params: Params) => {
  this.id = +params.id;
 });
}
```
```
import { interval } from 'rxjs;

someMethod() {
  interval(1000).subscribe(count => {
    console.log(count);
  })
 }
 ```
