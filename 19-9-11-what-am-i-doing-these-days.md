Well I have been in the land of Jest for about a month now.

Before then, I knew of Jest but I didn't know Jest. 
At this point, I feel I have a pretty good grasp on unit testing Vue with Jest.

I was looking at the unit tests for Steven Grider's famous Data Structures and Algorithms Course, which I have worked through
many times before over the years, and I was surprised to see that I could read and understand all of the Jest tests.

Bouncing around so many different technologies, libraries, frameworks, etc, it's easy to lose sight of the progress I have 
made in my ongoing quest of continual improvement as a developer. It's not always easy to track self-improvement. But it was 
nice to notice a rather obvious example of improvement here.
